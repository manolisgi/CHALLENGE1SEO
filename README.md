## Description 

I made this website in order to advertise Horiseon. I wanted a simple and robust page with all the necessary information that makes the company a pioneer in its field and makes it stand out from all the rest.


## Usage 

The page has a navigation pane in the header with three tabs that leed to the main informative sections in the main part of the page. 
At the right side of the page we display the comparative advantages of the company.


## Credits

This page wouldn't exist without the help of the TA's and the collaboration of the bootcamp students.
